- As a QA Engineer I love to discuss about software testing. Apart from that I also like learning programming. However in my opinion, comparing testers who can code to testers who donâ€™t code is plain wrong.

- Personally I think Automated test is not meant to replace creative testing. Rather, it is a mean to take testing process to another level; to make it more efficient and effective.

# Tools
Tools I use (or used) for testing purposes:
- [Karate](https://intuit.github.io/karate/)
- [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)
- [Appium](http://appium.io/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [QATouch](https://www.qatouch.com/)
- [Software Testing Heuristics](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/software-testing-heuristics-mind-the-gap)


# Repository
Check out my repository at [https://github.com/dnomyar90](https://github.com/dnomyar90){:target="_blank"}

I personally recommend checking the [football-karate-demo-graphql](https://github.com/dnomyar90/football-karate-demo-graphql). You can have a hands-on experience on [karate](https://intuit.github.io/karate/), which is a great test framework that more people need to hear about.
